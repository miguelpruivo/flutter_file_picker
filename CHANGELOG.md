## 1.3.3

**Bug fixes**
 * Fixes an issue where sometimes a single file path was being returned as a `List` instead of `String`.
 * `requestCode` in Android intents are now restricted to 16 bits.

## 1.3.2

**Bug fix:** Returns a `null` value in the `getFile()` when the picker is canceled.

## 1.3.1

**Bug fix:** Fixes an issue on Android, where other activity would try to call `FilePicker`'s result object when it shouldn't.  

## 1.3.0

**Breaking changes**
 * `FileType.CAMERA` is no longer available, if you need it, you can use this package along with [image_picker](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/image_picker).
 
**New features**
 * You can now pick multiple files by using the `getMultiFilePath()` method which will return a `Map<String,String>` with all paths from selected files, where the key matches the file name and the value its path. Optionally, it also supports filtering by file extension, otherwise all files will be selectable. Nevertheless, you should keep using `getFilePath()` for single path picking.
 * You can now use `FileType.AUDIO` to pick audio files. In iOS this will let you select from your music library. Paths from DRM protected files won't be loaded (see README for more details).
 * Adds `getFile()` utility method that does the same of `getFilePath()` but returns a `File` object instead, for the returned path.
 
**Bug fixes and updates**
 * This package is no longer attached to the [image_picker](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/image_picker), and because of that, camera permission is also no longer required.
 * Fixes an issue where sometimes the _InputStream_ wasn't being properly closed. Also, its exception is now being forward to the plugin caller.
 * Fixes an issue where the picker, when canceled, wasn't calling the result callback on the underlying platforms.

## 1.2.0

**Breaking change**: Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're using the original support library.

## 1.1.1

**New features**
