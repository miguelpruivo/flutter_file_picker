## 3.1.0

- Implemented `PlatformFile.lengthSync()`, returning the browser's `File.size` (or the loaded bytes' length) synchronously, without doing any I/O.

## 3.0.3

- Tightened the `file_picker_platform_interface` lower bound to `^3.2.0`. This package's `pickFile()`/`pickFiles()` signatures reference `DarwinOptions`, added in that version, so resolving against an older one would fail to compile.

## 3.0.2

- Fixed the `window` `focus` listener used to detect a cancelled picker dialog never being removed after use. `removeEventListener` was passed a freshly created `.toJS` function object on every call, which never matches the one originally passed to `addEventListener`, so the listener leaked on `window` on every `pickFiles`/`pickFile` call. The JS function references are now cached and reused for both add and remove.

## 3.0.1

- Improved package description, added example, and added missing API documentation.
